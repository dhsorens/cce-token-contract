# FA2 Contract for the CCE Carbon Token

This repository is for the FA2 contract that represents the carbon token developed by the Center for Carbon Economics at the University of Cambridge.

Over time, this will hopefully also house the AMM contract attached to it that serves as an exchange, pricing carbon tokens and putting them onto the open market.
