# Roadmap and Requirements for an Automated Market for Semi-fungible tokens 

Should have:
* Price movement if something is undervalued -- someone can buy a carbon token they think is undervalued and if they're right then the value should go up over time.
    * Trade volume should induce price change to reflect market preferences.
* Project owners should have the option to sell their tokens immediately at a "market rate"
    * I envision this happening where a project owner puts their tokens "into the market" -- a collective pool where people can deposit tez or tokens into, get a "credit" and be able to withdraw anything from the pool of equivalent value according to the ranking mechanism.


The ranking mechanism initially can rely on additionality, leakage, permanence, (and biodiversity?). We need a good ranking mechanism.
* This should be implemented in a modular way so that a new standard could be implemented that will change price/rankings.
* Any change should not shock the market, but only change things slowly over time.
    * Part of that will be we want a ranking mechanism that is good enough to last and not need many edits -- edits would be small optimisations.
    * Either that, or have some system of pricing
