# Roadmap and Requirements for an Automated Market for Semi-fungible tokens 

Should have:
* Price movement if something is undervalued -- someone can buy a carbon token they think is undervalued and if they're right then the value should go up over time.
    * Trade volume should induce price change to reflect market preferences. This connects price to supply/demand.
* Project owners should have the option to sell their tokens immediately at a "market rate"
    * I envision this happening where a project owner puts their tokens "into the market" -- a collective pool where people can deposit tez or tokens into, get a "credit" and be able to withdraw anything from the pool of equivalent value according to the ranking mechanism.
    * If a carbon token holder believes that their carbon token will go down in price over time, 


The ranking mechanism initially can rely on additionality, leakage, permanence, (and biodiversity?). We need a good ranking mechanism.
* This should be implemented in a modular way so that a new standard could be implemented that will change price/rankings.
* Any change should not shock the market, but only change things slowly over time.
    * Part of that will be we want a ranking mechanism that is good enough to last and not need many edits -- edits would be small optimisations.
    * Either that, or have some system of pricing 
* Things that are harder to do should be more profitable for the people that do them. BURNT tokens incentivize this well.

Token holders can burn their tokens and will receive a token in return. There might be a market for these. It should be a "burnt" token; this will be a **social utility token** (!!).
* People can build platforms where this is the currency, or gives special access

Food for thought, what if this were the purpose?:
* The real goal of this project is to produce a BURNT token on which people can build their eco-friendly platforms
    * To truly brand your platform as eco friendly, you only accept BURNT tokens, literally creating demand for and powering the carbon-negative marketplace.
* BURNT tokens can only be "mined" by harvesting carbon, literally converting a physical substance into a token in a way that helps take care of the planet, rather than polluting.
